============
- Jon Bloom at Cellarity, contact of Gleb
	- Intro: data is high dimensional "multimodal"
	- "common task framework": need to have open source data to properly benchmark modeling advances. (duh?)
		- This is correlated with ML advancements
		- TODO: what are dna motifs?
	- cells signals are noisy, and multimodal. Ground truth is fuzzier than other ML problems
	- Here we are talking about manually annotated real data (not generative) which is neither scalable nor completely objective
	- measurements tend to destroy the cells (only one measurement)
	- ****Recently there are new methods of doing high-throughput multimodal measurements
		- DNA accessability (ATAC) and nucleus with nuclear RNA
		- RNA measurement
		- cell surface protein measurement
	- Task one: predict one modality from the other (just like speech to text translation)
	- Task two: "align cells across modalities"...integrating single modality datasets
	- Task three: classify cells into identity and dynamical situations based on multimodal data
	- Some methods exist:
		- BABEL
		- MultiVI
		- Problem: they are not "common task framework"
	- So they made a dataset (used bone marrow) 
	- They've built some infra?
- Angela Piasco:
	- Biohub: generating large single cell atlas for all cell types
	- RNA is important, and, so far, most scalable. 
	- History: scTranscription was 2009. But new stuff popping up (e.g. ATAC, protein measurements)
	- Why single cell? Well, all cells are different despite same genome. 
	- Need to consider epigenetics
	- Each modality should be someone orthogonal to others. 
	- Work on Epigenome + transcriptome using 10x genomic kit. 
		- barcoded Gel beads, the match "poly(dt) sequence that enables production of barcoded, full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA for gene expression library." ?? and "Spacer sequence that enables barcode attachment to transposed DNA fragments for ATAC library" ?? 20:35 
	- Important: 
		- there is a fixed feature space for gene expression: count expected genes and amount of expression
		- for ATAC, feature space is variable because different things are accessible at different times. 
	-Other modality: CITE-seq. Make antibodies with a barcode to detect protein expression
- Chloe Villani
	- immune system is challenging, network of specialized organs spread through all tissues. 
	- large number of immune states that are different for every human
	- cells can change identities
	- need a scalable framework
	- How do you define a stable cell type?
	- How do you draw a border between types (it's fuzzy)
	- Hard to get unbiased labels/type definitions
	- Why bone marrow? Main side of blood production.
		- Talks about the way types branch out from stem cells. 29:40 We now know they diverge more or less continuously
		- This means there is inconsistent labeling and data. 
		- Bone marrow is well studied so ground truth is more clear.
		- It's continuous spectrum of cell types
		- disease relevant
		- commercially available
	- RNAseq defines cell types/states by expression
	- ATACseq define transitional states through critical transcription factor changes
	- Protein market data: a legacy market already used for decades
	- interesting data viz of markers vs cell types
	- used U-man?? seems to be a type of t-sne embedding
	- there is biological and technical (between lab) variability
	- current classifiers often miss rare cell states
	- It's hard to link states across modalities
	- Even nomenclatures is non-standardized
	- computational scalability is hard
- Daniel Burkhardt ML-scientist works with Jon
	- lists the goals of the old competition
		- new, inter-modality representations
		- cross-modality translation
		- matching modalities to cells, where cell data source is unknown. 
	- some interesting caveats about clustering problems that I didn't fully understand (50:00)
- Discussion, very broad and not very useful for this particular task
